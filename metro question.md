Assume you are a traffic engineer working for the Shanghai Metro and now you are assigned a mission to analyze how passengers travel by metro in the city. The company has collected the transit smart card transaction data (see the attachment). The smart card data contain the times that people pass through the metro entrances and exits, as well as their smart card ID and other relevant information. Now it’s time for you to use the data weapon to conquer the problem. 

Here are your tasks:

1. Extract the daily OD (Origin-Destination) matrix of Shanghai metro stations from the raw data. (You can present the result, i.e. the OD matrix, in your own way.)
2. Plot the hourly passenger inflow and outflow (how many passengers enter and leave a station per hour) line graphs between 6:00 am and 11:00 pm for the station Renmin Square.  Note that there are several metro lines passing through the Renmin Square station. You need to combine the data first and then plot. 

The data you have is for one day only. The data was organized by line, e.g. "602141128,2015-04-06,19:20:16,1号线莘庄,地铁,5.00".  Each item in the above example represents: the card id, date, transaction time, line number and station name, traffic mode (metro only) and fare (fare is charged when exiting).

You need to submit a brief report explaining your solution steps with programming code (any programming language is fine), and results presented via figures, tables, or files.
