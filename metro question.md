Assume you are a traffic engineer working in the Shanghai Metro and now you are assigned a mission to analyze how passengers travel through the metros in the city. The company has collected citizen public transit smart card transaction data, so you can easily get access it. The smart card system records the time people passing through the metro entrance and exit as well as their smart card information. Now it's time for you to use the data weapon to conquer the problem.

Here is your detail tasks:

1. Extract the daily OD matrix of Shanghai metro stations from the raw data. (You could use your own way to express the OD matrix.)
2. Plot the hourly passenger inflow and outflow (how many passengers enter and leave a station each hour) line graph between 6:00 am to 11:00 pm of the station Renmin Square (Note that there are several metro lines passing through Renmin Square station. You need to combine them first and then to plot the figure).

You only need to analyze one day's data as given. The data was organized by lines like "602141128,2015-04-06,19:20:16,1号线莘庄,地铁,5.00", which represented the card id, date, transaction time, station name, traffic mode (here only metro) and fees (fees only be charged when exiting).

Any programming languages is available, but you need to submit your main code. Figures or files to present your solution are required.
